# Student-s-Basic-Evaluation-Mobile-App

Student Evaluation App: Form Assessments is developed using Android Studio and Java. It is a simple mobile application that aims to capture different aspects of student performance inside and outside the classroom. Through a form, students can rate themselves on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest. The performance is divided into three specific categories: Learning Motivation/Attitude, Learning Objectives, and Behavioral Performance in Class.

EXCLUSIONS:

⚪ If the user fails to answer any questions, a Toast message will be displayed as a reminder to provide all the necessary information. The information will not be submitted until all required fields are filled in.

⚪ Equipped with a scrolling feature

⚪ Upon completion, the application will generate a notification with a personalized message saying "Hello [NAME], check your performance." Tapping on the notification will open a new activity called ViewResult(), where the user can view their performance details.
